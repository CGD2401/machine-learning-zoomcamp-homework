# Machine Learning Zoomcamp – Homework

This repository contains my solutions for the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025** course by [DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp).

## Structure
Each homework assignment is organized in a separate folder:
- `hw01-environment-pandas/` → Environment setup, Pandas, EDA, and linear regression with NumPy  


## Topics covered
- Setting up Python environments (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values
- Implementing linear regression from scratch
- Machine learning workflows (future assignments)

✅ This repository serves both as my learning log and as a portfolio of practical machine learning projects.
